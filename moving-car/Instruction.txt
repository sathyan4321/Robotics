Components Needed:
    1. Raspberry Pi Pico - 1,
        This is a microcontroller for the car.
    2. BO motors (recommended) or DC motors - 4 or 2,
        For movement, you'll need two or four motors (depending on the type of drive system)
    3. Motor Driver - (L298N or L293D)
        To control the motors
    4. Power Source: A battery pack for the motors
        (e.g., 6V or 9V depending on motor specs).
    5. Chassis with wheels: For the physical car body.
    6. Jumper wires: To connect everything.
    7. Breadboard: Optional, but useful for prototyping.
    8. Ultrasonic sensor (optional): For obstacle detection if you want more functionality (self-driving or autonomous stopping).


Circuit Connection:
    1. Connect the DC motors to the motor driver (e.g., L298N or L293D).
    2. Connect the motor driver's inputs (IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 for two motors) to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
    3. Connect the motor driver's power and ground pins to the Pico's power (3.3V or 5V) and ground.
    4. Power the motors using a separate battery (e.g., a 6V battery pack connected to the motor driver).
    5. If using an ultrasonic sensor, connect its trigger and echo pins to separate GPIO pins.
        VCC → Connect to 3.3V of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
        GND → Connect to Ground (GND) of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
        TRIG → Connect to GPIO pin 4 of the Pico.
        ECHO → Connect to GPIO pin 5 of the Pico.
